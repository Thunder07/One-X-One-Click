# One-X-One-Click

This is a tool I created in 2012,
It's a basic adb wrapper for Windows users, that acted as AIO tool for HTC One X users (however, the tool should in theory work with any android devices with fastboot support).

Basic functionality:

- Flash Kernels & Modules
- Flash Recoveries
- Reboot The Phone
- Reboot Into Recovery/Bootloader
- MultiKernel Repack
- One Click Root
- Added RUU Zip Flashing Ability - For Advanced Users
- Added Erase Cache
- Added Lock/Unlock Option For HTC devices (HTCDev's Unlock_Code.bin)
- Mobile and PC Based Repack (PC Repacker code was provided by XDA Member [Langer Hans](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=576676))
- IMG/APK Flasher/Installer (With The Open With Command)
- Added Logger (Logcat/kmsg/last_kmsg retriever)
- Added Android OS/Recovery ScreenShot Option (Thanks to XDA Member [Whiskey103](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2632943))

Thanks To:

- Daekin - For Providing The Tools For Repack
- ChainFire - For His SuperSU
- Langer Hans - For His PC Based Repack Code
- Whiskey103 - For Providing The Screencapture Binaries
