***Dont Touch The Apps Folder****
Kernels/Modules/Recoveries go into there respective folders,
and they will appear in the app 

Connect The Phone To The PC Via a USB Cable In Anymode (Android(With USB Debug)/Recovery/Bootloader) Though Preferably In The OS or The Recovery,
Choose The Option You Want, E.g. Flash Kernel
Choose The Option That Show Up, The Kernel & its Modules.
Choose What To Do On Completion
Click Perform Action, Site & Wait.

Some Actions need The Recovery IMG
Download The Latest Recovery and name it recovery.img and place it in the Recovery Folder,
Though i try to avoid it most of the time because it wont work on HBoot 0.34000 on HTC One X International Version (T3)
